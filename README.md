# computer-graphics
This project collects some examples created as I learn blender, Unity, and other graphics packages.

Feel free to download any of the source blender files as a jumping off point, or
as inspiration for your own project.  So far, most of my blender examples were
created as I work my way through this [Beginner 3D Illustrator Course](https://polygonrunway.com/p/become-a-3d-illustrator) from Roman Klƒço (Polygon Runway).
